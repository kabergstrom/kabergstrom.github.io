      <p>I've been thinking about how to manage asset artifacts for gamedev a bunch. It's a lot of data, and many humans are impatient. </p>
<p>I used LMDB for both metadata and artifacts in one attempt. I think there are two fatal issues that make me want to replace it. First, LMDB does not offer indexes, and it turns out asset metadata wants a bunch of those. Ends up being a ton of complicated code to hack on index-like features. Second, not many people are familiar with LMDB, or plain key-value stores in general.</p>
<p>I think SQLite seems all right for storing metadata. I did some tests with the mmap support, and with the right locking modes to reduce syscalls, it seems like it can offer really fast reads of small values. </p>
<p>SQLite's statement APIs assume column values are linear in memory though, so when reading a row value larger than the page size, the value gets copied into a &quot;result set&quot; buffer before being accessible to the application. I figure that's an issue when reading large values like asset artifacts.</p>
<p>So I thought all right, let's store asset artifacts in something else. <code>mmap</code> is super nice on user workstations because it allows to use the kernel's caching mechanism instead of application-managed caching. Can cache as much disk stuff as there's unused memory.</p>
<p>I thought about using just files. One file per asset artifact. Content-addressed, of course. But filesystems are poor databases, and the data structures used for looking up files in folders in order to open a file handle are not optimized for huge numbers. I figured it'd make sense to just do something like a heap allocator but disk-backed.</p>
<p>Create a few GB-sized files. Allocate space in a file for an artifact, write the artifact, fsync, then write the file range mapping to the SQLite database. Files always have problems though. This is no different, need to handle: </p>
<ul>
<li>Obsolete artifacts. Garbage collection based on active references in the SQLite metadata.</li>
<li>Failed writes, where there's no entry in the SQLite database for a range in the file.</li>
<li>Detection of data corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like it'd work. Sparse files would allow to free up disk space from removed artifacts. There are OS APIs for finding &quot;holes&quot; in a file, but I'm not sure it'll be any better than just allocating based on the tracked artifact ranges in the database.</p>
<p>Allocation of a range in a file would be sequential, but the writing of the artifact data can be parallel. Reading would also be maximally parallel. </p>
<p>Frostbite did a thing with splitting artifacts into fixed-size chunks, which are content addressed, to get some deduplication. </p>
